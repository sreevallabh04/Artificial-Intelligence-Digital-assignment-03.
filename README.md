# SWE4010 - Artificial Intelligence - Digital Assignment 03

This repository contains the code for the Digital Assignment 03 for the SWE4010 Artificial Intelligence course.

The assignment includes the following tasks:

- **Task 1: Robot Navigation**
  - Implements a navigation system for a smart robot in a grid-based warehouse.
  - Demonstrates and compares informed (A*) and uninformed (BFS) search algorithms for finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles.
  - Includes interactive visualization of the warehouse, search process, and the final path.

- **Task 2: Delivery Route Planner**
  - Implements a smart route planner for a delivery robot visiting multiple locations (Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP).
  - Compares multiple TSP algorithms: Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, Genetic Algorithm, and Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
  - Provides interactive visualization of delivery points, routes, and algorithm performance.

- **Task 3: Diagnostic Assistant**
  - Implements an AI-based medical diagnostic assistant using a knowledge base and rules.
  - Utilizes forward and backward reasoning techniques to infer likely diseases based on patient symptoms.
  - Includes visualization of the inference chains and compares the reasoning approaches.
